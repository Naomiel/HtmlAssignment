            <img src="images/Naomi.png" alt="Profile Image">
            <p>
                My name is Unuakpa Naomi Akpevweoghne, and I am a graduate of Biology from the Federal University Otuoke, Bayelsa. Over time, I have developed a strong passion for technology, 
                with a particular interest in backend engineering and its role in driving innovation within the fintech space.
                My journey into tech began with a curiosity about how digital financial solutions are built, secured, and optimized for seamless transactions. This curiosity led me to explore 
                backend development, where I discovered the intricate processes that power modern applications. I am particularly 
                fascinated by how backend systems handle data processing, ensure security, and enhance the efficiency of financial applications.
                As I continue to deepen my knowledge in backend engineering, I have also developed a keen interest in cloud technologies and their impact on application scalability, reliability, 
                and performance. Understanding how cloud infrastructure supports backend systems has further fueled my drive to build scalable and efficient solutions. My goal is to contribute 
                meaningfully to the fintech industry by developing robust backend architectures that leverage cloud technologies to enhance system efficiency and user experience.
